# MCSR Godot Import Plugin - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Godot import plugin for the Multi-Cam Sprite Renderer.

## Implementation Overview

The plugin has been implemented according to the specifications in `GODOT_IMPORT_ROADMAP.md` and provides:

### Core Features ✅
- **Metadata Parsing**: Reads and validates `metadata.json` files from the Blender addon
- **SpriteFrames Creation**: Generates Godot `SpriteFrames` resources with proper animations
- **Material Support**: Creates materials with normal map support for both 2D and 3D modes
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Handles different camera angles (camera_0 through camera_7)
- **Animation Timing**: Properly handles frame durations and animation speeds

### Editor Integration ✅
- **Custom Importer**: Automatically handles `.json` files that are MCSR metadata
- **Import Options**: Provides 2D and 3D import modes with various settings
- **Editor Dock**: UI panel for manual import and batch operations
- **Scene Generation**: Optional creation of sample scenes with configured nodes

### File Structure Support ✅
The plugin handles the expected file structure from the Blender addon:
```
project/
├── metadata.json
└── action_name/
    ├── camera_0/
    │   ├── diffuse.png
    │   ├── normal.png
    │   └── ...
    └── camera_N/
        ├── diffuse.png
        ├── normal.png
        └── ...
```

## Files Created

### Core Plugin Files
- `plugin.cfg` - Plugin configuration
- `plugin.gd` - Main plugin entry point
- `mcsr_importer.gd` - Custom import plugin implementation
- `mcsr_material_helper.gd` - Material and SpriteFrames creation logic

### Advanced Features
- `advanced_plugin.gd` - Enhanced plugin with editor dock
- `mcsr_dock.gd` - Editor UI dock for manual operations

### Documentation and Tools
- `README.md` - Comprehensive usage documentation
- `install.sh` - Installation script
- `sample_metadata.json` - Example metadata for testing

## Usage Workflow

1. **Installation**: Copy plugin to `addons/mcsr_importer/` and enable in project settings
2. **Export from Blender**: Use Multi-Cam Sprite Renderer to generate sprite sheets
3. **Import to Godot**: Copy files to project, plugin auto-imports `metadata.json`
4. **Use Resources**: Apply generated `SpriteFrames` and materials to nodes

## Technical Implementation

### Import Process
1. Detects `metadata.json` files using file extension and content validation
2. Parses JSON structure and validates required fields
3. Creates `SpriteFrames` resource with animations based on metadata
4. Generates appropriate materials (2D or 3D) with normal map support
5. Saves resources and optionally creates sample scenes

### Material Handling
- **2D Mode**: `CanvasItemMaterial` with normal texture for 2D lighting
- **3D Mode**: `StandardMaterial3D` with billboard settings for 3D environments

### Error Handling
- Validates metadata structure before processing
- Provides fallback paths for texture loading
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when optional resources are missing

## Alignment with Roadmap

This implementation addresses all milestones from `GODOT_IMPORT_ROADMAP.md`:

### ✅ Milestone 1: Basic Plugin Setup & Metadata Parsing
- Plugin configuration and registration
- File system monitoring for metadata files
- JSON parsing and validation

### ✅ Milestone 2: Texture Loading & SpriteFrames Creation
- Diffuse texture loading with multiple path fallbacks
- SpriteFrames resource creation with proper animations
- Frame duration handling based on metadata

### ✅ Milestone 3: Normal Map Integration
- Normal map texture loading
- Material creation for both 2D and 3D modes
- Automatic material assignment

### ✅ Milestone 4: Editor Integration & User Experience
- Custom importer registration
- Import options and presets
- Editor dock with manual import capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Milestone 5: Refinement
- Extensive documentation
- Installation tools
- Support for advanced features like multiple camera angles
- Scene generation capabilities

## Future Enhancements

The plugin is designed to be extensible and could support:
- Additional render passes (specular, depth, etc.)
- Custom shader configurations
- Advanced 3D effects using camera angle metadata
- Integration with Godot's animation system beyond SpriteFrames

## Testing

The plugin has been designed with error handling and validation to work with:
- Various metadata.json formats
- Missing texture files (graceful degradation)
- Different folder structures
- Both 2D and 3D use cases

Manual testing should be performed by:
1. Using the sample metadata file provided
2. Testing with actual exports from the Blender addon
3. Verifying both 2D and 3D import modes
4. Testing the editor dock functionality
